Hi! I am currently in the process of developing and deploying my own python web app as well as all infrastructure related to it via Terraform. My python app will not be the focus of my project.

I am very excited to learn Cloud concepts/IaC/Infrastructure architecture, and thought the best way to get this experience is to start deploying some of my own applications/servers. 

This project will likely result in me developing my knowledge in Azure networking, traffic management, events, monitoring, Autoscaling, the focus is really not on the web app. 

As I put more and more time into this I will start to implement more principles such as DLP, Availability, security aswell as revamping my architecture to work more around a hub-spoke architecture.

Thank you for reading.
